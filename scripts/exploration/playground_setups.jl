# Script for playing around with different equations and parameters for CTMLM
# There are two ways to specify the model equations;
# 1. use the `ctmlm_setup` function (this file) that makes same setups as in the paper
# 2. directly create your own equations (utilizing the default equations in defaults.jl),
# which is in the file `playground_equations.jl`

# From there, you specify what observables to visualize, and for which
# parameters to create sliders for. Both of these options are given
# after model initialization, which allows one to change change parameter
# sliders or observables visualized without restarting the model!
